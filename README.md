##  📍 Published project

## 🚀 To the next level
I made some new features to challenge myself, and improve the initial purpose:
- Micro-interactions implemented when the message is sent and appears on the main screen ✅
- Added a timeout when the message is sent, to prevent messages from flooding ✅ 
- Add support for English
